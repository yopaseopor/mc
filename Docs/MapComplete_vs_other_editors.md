# MapComplete versus other editors

**StreetCo**mplete + **MapCo**ntrib = MapComplete

## StreetComplete

StreetComplete might look pretty similar to MapComplete at first glance - especially as it was a huge inspiration. However, there are a few huge differences between the two, especially in vision.

### Vision

The core philosophy of StreetComplete is **OpenStreetMap is cool! Help to improve it by answering these questions**
The core philosophy of MapComplete is **Here is a map of topic XYZ - enjoy it and update it if there is still some info missing**

This means that StreetComplete is mainly aimed towards people who are already OpenStreetMap-enthusiasts, whereas MapComplete is aimed to an audience interested in a certain topic.
Of course, the next step is to attempt to inform that audience why having an open map is so cool and that they can contribute as well.

### Use cases

StreetComplete is to help mappers quickly gather some data on fixed topics

MapComplete is made to

- show the OSM-data in great detail for a specific theme about XYZ
- help mappers quickly add data for this theme if they are passing by
- be embedded in other websites
- allow the addition of new themes

### Technology

StreetComplete is an android app, so can only be used on Android Phones.

MapComplete is a web-app, and thus works on all devices. It can be installed as PWA to give an 'app-like'-experience, but can just as well be embedded in other websites. On the other hand PWA are a bit of a second class citizen compared to native apps.

### Feature comparison

MapComplete is also an OpenStreetMap-viewer, while StreetComplete hides known values.

MapComplete will not work offline.

In MapComplete it is easier to add more experimental, extremely detailed and more personal styles, as each topic is separated with its own part.

MapComplete is a bit more complex to use. One needs to go hunting for a specific map style rather than getting bunch of quests by default. And is likely to ask far more detailed question (email address and phone number of bicycle shop etc).
After all if it would duplicate StreetComplete it would be a bit pointless and it is pretty hard to compete with SC by being easier to use and more newbie friendly, while there is space for "more complicated/detailed/involved editor working like SC".

Also, MapComplete has no requirement to make question easy to answer, making both possible to ask more questions than StreetComplete but making it more complicated to use.

No support for splitting ways in MapComplete (as of now - hopefully it'll get added one day).

MapComplete allows the addition of new points, whereas StreetComplete does not.



## MapContrib

MapContrib is another very similar editor which served as inspiration. MapContrib offers - just like MapComplete - an extensible, thematic map view. However, I never understood the MapContrib user interface.

MapContrib also allows to add new points and to edit tags - but it is very cumbersome.

Note that the use case of MapContrib is much closer to MapComplete.
