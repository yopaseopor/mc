URL-parameters and URL-hash
============================

This document gives an overview of which URL-parameters can be used to influence MapComplete.

What is a URL parameter?
------------------------

URL-parameters are extra parts of the URL used to set the state.

For example, if the url is `https://mapcomplete.osm.be/cyclofix?lat=51.0&lon=4.3&z=5&test=true#node/1234`,
the URL-parameters are stated in the part between the `?` and the `#`. There are multiple, all seperated by `&`, namely:

- The url-parameter `lat` is `51.0` in this instance
- The url-parameter `lon` is `4.3` in this instance
- The url-parameter `z` is `5` in this instance
- The url-parameter `test` is `true` in this instance

Finally, the URL-hash is the part after the `#`. It is `node/1234` in this case.

custom-css (broken)

layout
--------
The layout to load into MapComplete

userlayout
------------
If not 'false', a custom (non-official) theme is loaded. This custom layout can be done in multiple ways:

- The hash of the URL contains a base64-encoded .json-file containing the theme definition
- The hash of the URL contains a lz-compressed .json-file, as generated by the custom theme generator
- The parameter itself is an URL, in which case that URL will be downloaded. It should point to a .json of a theme
  The default value is _false_
