What is MapComplete?
====================

MapComplete is a website where people can see a map of Points of Interest (POI) on a specific subject or theme.

If the visitor is logged in with their OpenStreetMap account, information about a selected POI can be enriched by answering questions in the respective popups; this data is sent back directly to OpenStreetMap.

While there are some predefined themes available, it is also possible to create your own theme. Have a look on [the OpenStreetMap-wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapComplete) for a list of (un)official themes.
