 Talk at State of the Map
 ========================

I'm planning to do a talk/video on MapComplete on _State of the Map 2021_. This document outlines the structure of the talk and serves as my speaker notes.

 Overview
 --------
 
 1. What is MapComplete? Three slides
 2. Already one year old!
    a. Where and how did it start? "This project isn't going anywhere"
        (buurtnatuur, cyclofix, Antwerpen, Natuurpunt, Oost-Vlaanderen?, Toerisme Vlaanderen?)
    b. Where are we now? Some cool statistics
 3. The vision
    a. Your granny can use it
    a. pragmatism - somewhat working today is better then something perfect tomorrow
    a. It's a trap! Cool thematic map (as iframe on website) -> the OSM rabbit hole -> easy start -> more features when mapping more -> oh, I can make a theme too!
     b. The pareto frontier of 'easy to use' vs 'number of features'
    c. The thematic approach (+ disabling/enabling features per theme/view) 


 4. The future
    a. paid projects? Microgrant for a better theme creator?
    b. user contributed themes (see you next talk!)
 5. OpenStreetMap is Cool!
